# Age-related_gait_classification

#### requirement
python = 3.x
TensorFlow-gpu >= 2.3  
keras-tuner == 1.1.0  
sklearn >= 0.24.1

### usage
- datasets and models can be found here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ao2D6nuqQGQ0qSq0uxpsK2wDfQTg?e=WcwgO8
- to tune the hyperparameters for deep learning models and machine learning models, run /tuning/run_dl_tuning.py and /tuning/run_ml_tuning.py    
- to compare the performance of deep learning or machine learning, use dl_main.py or ml_main.py
